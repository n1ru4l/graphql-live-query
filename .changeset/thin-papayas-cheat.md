**BREAKING CHANGE** The API of `LiveQueryStore`.

The `extractLiveQueryRootIdentifier` function was moved from `@n1ru4l/graphql-live-query` to `@n1ru4l/in-memory-live-query-store`, as it is an implementation detail of the `InMemoryLiveQueryStore`. The implementation could differ based on different store implementations. The function `extractLiveQueryRootIdentifier` was renamed to `extractLiveQueryRootFieldCoordinates` and is also no longer public.

The `InMemoryLiveQueryStore` can now also process query operations that use `Fragments` and `InlineFragments` on the `RootQueryType`.

The `operationName` is now also passed to the `LiveQueryStore.register` method.

```ts
import type { DocumentNode, ExecutionResult } from "graphql";

export type UnsubscribeHandler = () => void;
export type OperationVariables = { [key: string]: any } | null | undefined;

export type LiveQueryStoreRegisterParameter = {
  operationDocument: DocumentNode;
  operationName: string | null;
  operationVariables: OperationVariables;
  executeOperation: () => Promise<ExecutionResult>;
  publishUpdate: (executionResult: ExecutionResult, payload: any) => void;
};

export abstract class LiveQueryStore {
  abstract async triggerUpdate(identifier: string): Promise<void>;
  abstract register(
    params: LiveQueryStoreRegisterParameter
  ): UnsubscribeHandler;
}
```
