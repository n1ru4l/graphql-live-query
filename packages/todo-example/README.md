# TodoMVC Example App

This directory contains a GraphQL server for a todo app with full live query support.
That means all changes to the todo list are immediately synced across all schema consumers (web clients).

The backend is written with "plain" `graphql-js` and without any persistent storage. It is super lightweight and only has around ~300 lines of code.

There are three frontend implementations available that use the most widely adopted React GraphQL clients.

All the "frontends" use `create-react-app` as the base.

- Relay
- Apollo Client
- Urql

Each of those client apps also has with a GraphiQL IDE.
