# GraphQL Live Query

Implementation of GraphQL Live Queries for any GraphQL schema.

## Implementation

- [`@n1ru4l/in-memory-live-query-store`](packages/in-memory-live-query-store) - A simple query store that holds the queries in memory.
- [`@n1ru4l/graphql-live-query`](packages/graphql-live-query) - Basic utilities for determining live queries.
- [`@n1ru4l/socket-io-graphql-server`](packages/socket-io-graphql-server) - A layer for serving a GraphQL schema via a socket.io server. Supports Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions and Live Queries.
- [`@n1ru4l/socket-io-graphql-client`](packages/socket-io-graphql-client) - A network interface for consuming a GraphQL schema that is served via `@n1ru4l/socket-io-graphql-server`.
- [todo-example-app](packages/todo-example) - The classic Todo App - but with state that sync across clients

## Motivation

There was no live query implementation not tied to any specific database. This implementation should serve as an example how live queries can be added to any schema.

GraphQL already has a solution for real-time: Subscriptions. Thos are the right tool for responding to events. An example for this would be triggering a sound or showing a toast message once a new message has been received. Subscriptions are also often used for updating existing query results on the client. Depending on the complexity cache update code can eventually become pretty bloated. Often it is more straight-forward to simply refetch the query once a subscription event is received.

In contrast live queries should feel magically and update the UI with the latest data from the server without having to write any cache update wizardry code on the client.

## Concept

A live query is a query operation that is annotated with a `@live` directive.

```gql
query users @live {
  users(first: 10) {
    id
    login
  }
}
```

A live query is sent to the server (via a transport that supports delivering partial execution results) and registered.
The client receives a immediate execution result and furthermore receives additional execution results once the live query operation was invalidated and therefore the client data became stale.

The client can inform the server that it is no longer interested in the query (unsubscribe the live query operation).

On the server we have a live query invalidation mechanism that is used for determining which queries have become stale, and thus need to be rescheduled for execution.

### How does the server know the underlying data has changed?

The reference live query store implementation must be notified once a resource becomes stale.

A resource (in terms of the reference implementation) is described by a root query field schema coordinate (such as `Query.viewer` or `Query.users`),
but also by a resource identifier (such as `User:1`). The latter is by default composed out of the resource typename and the non nullable id field of the given GraphQL type.

For the following type:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

A legitimate resource identifier would be `User:1`, `User:2`, `User:dfsg12`. Where the string after the first colon describes the id of the resource.

Practical example:

```js
// somewhere inside a mutation resolver
await db.users.push(createNewUser());
// all live queries that select Query.users are invalidated and scheduled for re-execution.
liveQueryStore.invalidate("Query.users");
```

### How are the updates sent/applied to the client

The transport layer can be any transport that allows sending partial execution results to the client.

Most GraphQL clients (including GraphiQL) have support for Observable data structures which are perfect for describing both Subscription and Live Queries. Ideally a GraphQL Live Query implementation uses a Observable for pushing the latest query data to the client framework that consumes the data.

Inside this mono-repository there is Socket.io GraphQL transport that uses WebSockets and HTTP polling.

Further optimizations could be achieved. E.g. the LiveQueryStore could only send patches to the client which should be applied to the initial query result or clients that have the same selection set could be merged so that the query must be only executed once when the underlying data changes.

A distributed backend with many clients could leverage a query store that relies on redis etc.
